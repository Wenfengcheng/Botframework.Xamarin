# Botframework.Xamarin
This is an example app for using the [C# DirectLine Client](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/CSharp/core-DirectLine) with native controls in a Xamarin Forms Project

## Warning

This project was created with an alpha version of Adaptive Cards renderer. It's now deprecated.

# Features

This renderer is still in alpha - for now, we've included a prerelease dll in a libs folder, but we plan to move to NuGet ASAP
